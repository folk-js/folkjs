## Central Nexus

> The geometric and governmental center of Aetheria, housing both its administrative functions and primary research facilities.

The Central Nexus rises from the center of [[Aetheria]] as a towering spire of prismatic crystal, standing over 500 meters tall. Its distinctive helical structure is composed of self-replicating [[Crystalline Architecture:crystalline matrices]] that gradually repair and extend themselves over time, making the building a living monument to Aetherian engineering.

### Governance

The upper levels house the chambers of [[The Atmospheric Council]], where the seven elected representatives manage Aetheria's civic affairs and diplomatic relations with [[The Mist Sovereigns]]. Public observation decks allow citizens to witness council proceedings through transparent crystal walls.

### Research Divisions

The middle and lower sections contain the primary scientific facilities, including the Department of [[Quantum Foldspace:Quantum Studies]] where [[Dr. Elara Venn]] conducted her groundbreaking experiments. The controversial [[Temporal Communications]] lab occupies a shielded sublevel.
