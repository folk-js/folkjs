## Earth Temporal Regulations Commission

> A powerful regulatory body on Earth dedicated to monitoring and controlling temporal research and technologies across human settlements in the solar system.

Established in 2420 following early [[Quantum Foldspace:foldspace]] experiments that produced concerning temporal anomalies, the Earth Temporal Regulations Commission (ETRC) oversees all research related to time manipulation, dilation, and observation. Operating under the authority of the United Earth Government, the Commission has broad powers to restrict or shut down technologies deemed to pose risks to temporal stability.

### Conflict with Aetheria

The ETRC has repeatedly attempted to assert jurisdiction over [[Aetheria:Aetherian]] [[Temporal Communications]] research, claiming that experiments conducted by [[Dr. Elara Venn]] and her team could potentially create cascading causality violations affecting the entire solar system. [[The Atmospheric Council]] has firmly rejected these claims, citing Aetheria's sovereign status and the technology's importance to their independent development.

### Current Status

While lacking direct enforcement capability in Aetherian space, the ETRC maintains a permanent observer presence aboard the [[Galileo Research Station]] and has imposed trade restrictions on temporal technology exports from Aetheria to Earth-controlled territories. Recent diplomatic initiatives suggest a possible compromise may be developing, with Aetheria offering to share safety protocols in exchange for reduced oversight.
