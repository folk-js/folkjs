### The Atmospheric Council

> The governing body of Aetheria, composed of seven elected representatives who manage both internal affairs and diplomatic relations with the Mist Sovereigns.

Established in 2392 after [[Aetheria]] declared independence from Earth's Colonial Administration, the Atmospheric Council operates on a consensus model rather than majority rule. Council members serve five-year terms with a two-term limit, ensuring regular rotation of leadership.

### The Diplomatic Crisis of 2433

The Council faced its greatest challenge during [[The Mist Sovereigns:The Mist Sovereign]] conflict of 2433, when energy field expansions into the lower atmosphere were interpreted as territorial aggression by the native entities. Council Chair [[Takashi Moreau]] personally descended into the storm layers of [[Jovian-9]] to negotiate, establishing the historic Atmospheric Accord that has maintained peace ever since.

### Current Policies

Today's Council focuses on sustainable growth, maintaining equilibrium with the planet's atmospheric systems, and expanding [[Quantum Foldspace]] transportation networks. Recent debates have centered on whether to permit [[Temporal Communications]] research despite concerns from some [[Earth Temporal Regulations Commission:Earth factions]].
