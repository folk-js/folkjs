### Crystalline Architecture

> A revolutionary construction methodology using programmable, self-organizing crystal structures that respond to both environmental conditions and deliberate control inputs.

Developed in 2402 by architect [[Sarai Nimura]], Crystalline Architecture forms the distinctive aesthetic of [[Aetheria]]. The buildings utilize specially engineered crystal matrices that grow according to programmed patterns, allowing structures to be "cultivated" rather than constructed in the traditional sense.

### Technical Properties

The crystals are composed primarily of silicon-carbon compounds with trace elements that enable semi-organic growth patterns. Each structure contains a network of nanoscale control nodes that can trigger limited reconfiguration, allowing buildings to adapt to changing weather conditions on [[Jovian-9]] or expand to accommodate population growth.

### Notable Examples

The [[Central Nexus]] represents the pinnacle of this architectural style, but other striking examples include the Resonance Amphitheater and the intricate latticework of the [[Suspended Gardens]], where crystal structures have been programmed to provide optimal growing conditions for terrestrial plants.
