## Galileo Research Station

> An orbital scientific facility dedicated to the study of Jovian-9's atmospheric and planetary systems, and home to the most comprehensive database of Jovian meteorological patterns.

Established in 2395 as a joint venture between the [[Earth Temporal Regulations Commission]] and [[Aetheria:Aetherian]] researchers, the Galileo Research Station maintains a stable orbit 12,000 kilometers above Jovian-9's upper atmosphere. The toroidal structure houses laboratories, living quarters for 200 scientists and support staff, and powerful sensor arrays that continuously monitor the planet below.

### Research Focus

The station's primary mission involves long-term study of [[Jovian-9:Jovian-9's]] unique atmospheric systems, particularly the interactions between [[The Mist Sovereigns]] and the planet's weather patterns. Its massive data archives contain continuous observations dating back nearly 40 years, providing invaluable insights into Jovian climatology.

### Recent Discoveries

In 2439, researchers at Galileo made the surprising discovery that the Great Red Vortex exhibits quantum resonance patterns similar to those used in [[Quantum Echolocation]], suggesting it may serve as a natural foldspace aperture under specific conditions. This finding has attracted considerable interest from [[Dr. Elara Venn]] and her team.
