## Sarai Nimura

> Revolutionary architect and developer of Crystalline Architecture, whose designs transformed Aetheria from a utilitarian outpost into a floating marvel of living crystal.

Born in Neo-Tokyo in 2368, Sarai Nimura studied traditional architecture before specializing in biomimetic design at the Institute for Advanced Materials. She arrived in [[Aetheria]] in 2398 during early construction phases, when the settlement still consisted primarily of prefabricated habitation modules.

### Architectural Revolution

Nimura's breakthrough came after studying the silicon-based microorganisms that naturally occur in [[Jovian-9:Jovian-9's]] upper atmosphere. By adapting their crystalline growth patterns and combining them with programmable nanomaterials, she developed the first self-organizing [[Crystalline Architecture]] that could be "grown" rather than built, dramatically reducing construction resources needed in Aetheria's challenging environment.

### Legacy

The [[Central Nexus]] stands as Nimura's masterpiece, but her influence extends throughout Aetheria in the harmonious integration of function and form. Her current work focuses on developing new crystal variations that can interface directly with the atmospheric manipulation technologies used for communication with [[The Mist Sovereigns]], potentially enabling architectural features that respond directly to their [[Storm Poetry]].
