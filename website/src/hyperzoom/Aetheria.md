## Aetheria

> A floating city-state in the upper atmosphere of Jovian-9, renowned for its advanced teleportation technology and crystalline architecture.

Established in 2387 as a scientific research outpost, Aetheria evolved into a sovereign technological haven within decades. The city hovers within the upper cloud layers of [[Jovian-9]], protected by a powerful energy field that maintains Earth-like conditions within its boundaries.

### Notable Locations

The [[Central Nexus]] serves as both governmental center and research facility. The sprawling **Cloudwalker District** houses most of the 50,000 permanent residents, while the **Prism Gardens** feature exotic flora that thrive in the unusual atmospheric conditions.

### Technology

Aetheria's prosperity is largely built upon its revolutionary [[Quantum Foldspace]] technologies, which have made it the hub of interplanetary commerce in the outer solar system. The city's [[Crystalline Architecture]] serves both aesthetic and functional purposes.
