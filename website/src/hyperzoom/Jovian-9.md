## Jovian-9

> The ninth planet in the Jovian system, a massive gas giant characterized by its stunning banded atmosphere and the famous Great Red Vortex.

Discovered in 2189 by the Galileo-Cassini deep space telescope, Jovian-9 is approximately 2.3 times the size of Jupiter with 5.7 times its mass. Its rapid rotation (a day lasts just 7.8 Earth hours) creates pronounced atmospheric bands of swirling gases in vibrant hues of amber, turquoise, and violet.

### The Great Red Vortex

The planet's most distinctive feature is the Great Red Vortex, an anticyclonic storm system that has persisted for at least 400 years. Spanning roughly 30,000 kilometers in diameter, the vortex serves as a spiritual center for the native [[The Mist Sovereigns: Mist Sovereigns]] and generates powerful electromagnetic pulses that have complicated human exploration.

### Human Settlements

The floating city-state of [[Aetheria]] remains the only permanent human settlement, hovering in the upper atmosphere. Several research outposts orbit the planet, including the [[Galileo Research Station]], which conducts ongoing atmospheric studies.

### Resources

Jovian-9's atmosphere is rich in valuable isotopes used in [[Quantum Foldspace]] technology, which has driven much of the economic interest in the planet despite the challenging conditions.
