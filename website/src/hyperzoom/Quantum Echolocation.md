## Quantum Echolocation

> A navigation technology that uses quantum resonance patterns to map foldspace pathways and detect objects across dimensional boundaries.

Developed as a safety system for early [[Quantum Foldspace]] travel experiments, Quantum Echolocation works by emitting precisely calibrated quantum particles that maintain entanglement with their source. As these particles encounter matter or energy fields, they generate distinctive resonance patterns that can be measured and interpreted to create multidimensional maps.

### Applications

Beyond its primary use in foldspace navigation, the technology has proven valuable for detecting anomalies in normal space-time, particularly in regions with unusual gravitational properties. [[The Mist Sovereigns]] have demonstrated a natural ability that closely resembles this technology, suggesting possible biological implementations.

### Recent Developments

Recent refinements by [[Dr. Elara Venn:Dr. Venn's]] team at the [[Central Nexus]] have enabled the detection of what appear to be faint "echoes" of past and future states, leading to speculation about potential applications in [[Temporal Communications:temporal observation]]. These findings remain highly classified by order of [[The Atmospheric Council]].
