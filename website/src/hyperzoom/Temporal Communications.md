Temporal Communications

> An experimental technology that exploits time dilation effects within foldspace to enable near-instantaneous communication across vast distances.

While conventional transmissions are limited by light-speed, temporal communications utilize the unique properties of [[Quantum Foldspace:foldspace]] to effectively "shortcut" these limitations. The technology emerged from [[Dr. Elara Venn:Dr. Elara Venn's]] later research, when she discovered that information could be encoded in quantum-entangled particles and transmitted through carefully calibrated foldspace apertures with minimal temporal distortion.

### Current Implementation

The primary temporal communications array is housed in a shielded chamber beneath the [[Central Nexus]] of [[Aetheria]]. While still experimental, the system has successfully maintained real-time connections with Earth outposts over 700 million kilometers away, revolutionizing interplanetary coordination and commerce.

### Controversy

The technology remains controversial among some theoretical physicists who warn of potential causality violations if the system were to experience critical failures. The [[Earth Temporal Regulations Commission]] has repeatedly attempted to restrict research in this field, creating ongoing tension with [[The Atmospheric Council]], which views the technology as essential to Aetheria's independence and prosperity.
