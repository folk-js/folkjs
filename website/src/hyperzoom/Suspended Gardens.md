## Suspended Gardens

> A botanical wonder suspended beneath Aetheria's main platform, featuring Earth plants growing in crystalline structures attuned to their specific needs.

Created in 2415 as both a psychological comfort for [[Aetheria:Aetherian]] residents and a practical source of fresh produce, the Suspended Gardens hang beneath the city's main platform, taking advantage of the more humid atmospheric conditions at lower altitudes. Architect [[Sarai Nimura]] designed the complex network of [[Crystalline Architecture:crystalline]] growing chambers that automatically adjust light, temperature, and moisture levels to the needs of different plant species.

### Ecological Systems

The Gardens function as a self-sustaining ecosystem, with each chamber carefully balanced to support specific plant communities. Pollination is managed by specially engineered microdrones that mimic the behavior of Earth insects. Water is harvested directly from [[Jovian-9:Jovian-9's]] atmosphere through condensation systems that can extract up to 10,000 liters daily during optimal conditions.

### Cultural Importance

Beyond their practical value, the Gardens serve as an important cultural space for Aetherians, many of whom have never visited Earth. Regular gatherings and ceremonies take place among the green spaces, and certain sections have been dedicated to growing plants that hold religious or cultural significance to different Earth traditions. The Gardens also host an annual festival during which [[The Mist Sovereigns]] create gentle [[Storm Poetry]] performances specially designed to stimulate plant growth.
