        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
          The social model of disability holds that disability is produced by environments, not by bodies — that when
          software fails to accommodate a person’s needs, the environment is disabling them. We argue that the dominant
          organization of computing produces such interaction mismatches structurally: the commodity form of software
          requires a standardized consumer, and everyone whose needs diverge from this imagined subject is disabled by
          the software environment. The substrates research community has identified properties — disclosure,
          composability, malleability — that would address this, but the commodity form actively selects against these
          properties because they dissolve the boundaries on which exchange value depends. This raises a question: how
          can infrastructure organized against the grain of commodity logic be made durable? We find a precedent in
          accessibility infrastructure — sustained not by patronage but by the organized counter-power of disability
          rights movements. Through Allio, a system for cross-application augmentation built on accessibility APIs, we
          illustrate both what this foundation makes possible and where its limits lie. We argue that the accessibility
          case reframes the substrates programme’s central challenge as political-economic: the question of who sustains
          substrate infrastructure, and through what social mechanisms, is as important as the question of what
          properties it should have.
        </p>
        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          In 1976, the Union of the Physically Impaired Against Segregation argued that it is society, not impairment,
          that disables people — that disability is imposed by environments which unnecessarily isolate and exclude. The
          <em>social model of disability</em>, as Oliver later formalized it, draws a distinction between
          <em>impairment</em> — a bodily or cognitive characteristic — and <em>disability</em> — the barriers that an
          environment places in a person’s way. <a id="loc-1" href="#loc-16" role="doc-biblioref">[1]</a> Disability is
          an <em>interaction mismatch</em>, produced by environments that fail to account for the people who must
          navigate them <a id="loc-2" href="#loc-17" role="doc-biblioref">[2]</a>. A person with a broken arm, a bus
          driver who cannot look at a screen, and a worker in a loud factory are all, in their context, disabled by an
          environment that assumes two free hands, constant visual attention, or a quiet room.
        </p>
        <p>
          Software produces interaction mismatches at enormous scale. The dominant organization of computing —
          mass-produced applications, each enclosing its own data, tools, and representations — serves the
          <em>unmarked user</em>, the imagined subject of the dominant and most profitable demographic, while
          systematically failing the long tail of everyone else
          <a id="loc-3" href="#loc-18" role="doc-biblioref">[3]</a>. We believe this is not a flaw in particular
          applications but a structural feature of the model: siloed, one-size-fits-all software, sold and distributed
          as discrete units, reflecting the priorities of its producers. What a person needs but the producer did not
          anticipate is, in the precise sense of the social model, <em>disabled</em> — not because the need is
          illegitimate but because the environment fails to accommodate it.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the problem is produced by how software is organized rather than a deficiency in the people who use it,
          then an intervention at the root requires a change in the organization of software itself. The substrates
          research community has explored what such a reorganization might look like:
          <em>computational materials</em> that disclose their internal structure, that are composable and can be
          operated on by instruments from any source, and that blur the distinction between programming and use. In this
          vision, the fundamental unit of software shifts from the <em>product</em> (an application, bounded and owned
          by a producer) to the <em>material</em> (a computational medium that exists independently of any particular
          application and can be worked on and adapted across many contexts of use). But one cannot have rich
          computational materials without a structural separation between the materials and the tools — having wood and
          nails means nothing if you can only use the nails from select suppliers with business ties to the wood vendor.
          A shift to material-centric computing is a reorganization not just of software’s properties but of its
          ontology: what the basic objects of computing are, and how social and economic processes produce them.
        </p>
        <p>
          We argue that disability studies provides both an analytical framework and a political precedent for this
          programme. The social model’s analysis — that interaction mismatches are produced by environments, not by
          bodies — parallels the condition substrates research diagnoses, and through political organizing, litigation,
          and standards work, disability rights movements produced the only infrastructure in contemporary computing
          that organizes software by <em>what things are</em> rather than who made them: accessibility infrastructure
          present on every major consumer operating system.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this paper we examine accessibility infrastructure as a foundation for substrate-oriented work, illustrate
          what it makes possible through Allio — a system for cross-application augmentation built on this foundation —
          and argue that the accessibility case reframes the substrates programme’s central challenge as
          political-economic.
        </p>
        <h2>2. Software as Commodity</h2>
        <p>
          The substrates community has identified desirable properties that software largely does not have: programming
          and use on a spectrum rather than distinct <a id="loc-4" href="#loc-19" role="doc-biblioref">[4]</a>, no
          technical distinction between manipulating tools and data
          <a id="loc-5" href="#loc-20" role="doc-biblioref">[5]</a>, disclosure that makes the path from use to
          modification “reasonably direct” <a id="loc-6" href="#loc-21" role="doc-biblioref">[6]</a>. The dominant
          application model denies all of these: source code is hidden and often illegal to modify, data formats are
          largely proprietary, internal structure is opaque. But <em>why</em> does software take this form?
        </p>
        <p>
          Through the personal computing era and into the present, the application boundary can be understood as the
          <em>commodity boundary</em> — the unit that can be named, sold, installed, updated, and owned by a producer.
          An application must be a discrete unit that can be exchanged; it requires a producer-consumer relation between
          developer and user; and because software can be copied at zero marginal cost, it requires artificial scarcity
          mechanisms — proprietary formats, restricted APIs, platform lock-in, source secrecy — to sustain exchange
          value. This is not a neutral technical arrangement but a self-reinforcing one. As Tchernavskij demonstrates,
          Parnas’s invention of information hiding was motivated by a specific mode of production: top-down, centralized
          management of large disconnected teams in an industrial design process.
          <a id="loc-7" href="#loc-22" role="doc-biblioref">[7]</a> This technique, devised for commodity production,
          became encapsulation in object-oriented programming and embedded itself in compilers, frameworks, and IDEs.
          The mode of production inscribes itself in the tools; the tools reproduce the mode of production.
        </p>
        <p>
          The social model helps clarify what this feedback loop produces at the level of the user. Commodity software
          must address a market which requires a <em>generalizable</em> consumer. The technical enclosure of the
          application — its sealed data, hidden source, proprietary formats — is simultaneously an enclosure of the user
          within a fixed set of anticipated needs. The further a person’s actual needs diverge from the producer’s
          model, the more the software environment disables them. This is not a failure of empathy on the part of
          individual developers; it is a structural consequence of the commodity form, which must produce
          Costanza-Chock’s <em>unmarked user</em> — the default subject of the dominant and most profitable demographic
          — as its standard subject in order to produce software as a standard commodity.
          <a href="#loc-18" role="doc-biblioref">[3]</a> The properties substrates research seeks — disclosure,
          composability, malleability — are not merely absent from contemporary software but are properties that the
          commodity form structurally selects <em>against</em>, because they dissolve the boundaries on which exchange
          value depends.
        </p>
        <p>
          Church and Samosir observe that “software can only live in tension with the epistemic power of its
          surroundings for brief periods of time, and at the expense of significant investments of energy by the people
          building it.”
          <a id="loc-8" href="#loc-23" role="doc-biblioref">[8]</a> This captures the trajectory of every designed
          substrate: HyperCard, OpenDoc, Smalltalk environments, and contemporary research prototypes persist only as
          long as someone sustains them against the prevailing logic of commodity software production. Interoperability
          is a <em>negative externality</em> of the commodity form — for any individual software producer, making their
          product work well with competitors’ reduces lock-in and thus profit. A 1987 Stanford paper on legal protection
          for product standards demonstrated that IP protection <em>strengthens the incentive</em> to develop
          incompatible standards, and the reward for successful incompatibility <em>increases with market share</em>.
          <a id="loc-9" href="#loc-24" role="doc-biblioref">[9]</a> We believe this commodity logic, now embedded in our
          tools, techniques, and infrastructure, is a core obstacle to the substrates research programme.
        </p>
        <h2>3. Accessibility Infrastructure</h2>
        <p>
          The earliest accessibility infrastructure was adversarial: in text-based systems of the 1970s, screen readers
          extracted text from video card buffers without the application’s knowledge; when graphical interfaces arrived
          in the 1980s, they resorted to patching rendering systems and display drivers to reverse-engineer what was on
          screen.
          <a id="loc-10" href="#loc-25" role="doc-biblioref">[10]</a> These techniques anticipate, in crude form, the
          kind of cross-application instrumentation that substrates research envisions with far richer infrastructure.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now every major operating system provides an accessibility framework: macOS’s Accessibility API, Windows’s UI
          Automation, GNOME’s AT-SPI over D-Bus, and corresponding mobile frameworks on iOS and Android. Applications
          expose their interactive elements — buttons, text fields, sliders, menus, tables — as a tree of nodes
          described using a shared vocabulary of roles, states, attributes, and actions. The tree is queryable at
          runtime. Elements can be discovered, inspected, and — to varying degrees — acted upon by external processes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Users whose work does not fit neatly into application boundaries must perform constant, silent translation
          between incommensurable descriptions of their own activity. Other cross-application infrastructure does not
          solve this: the filesystem addresses data at rest, platform automation like AppleScript or D-Bus exposes only
          what individual applications choose to offer, and protocols like SMTP or HTTP are channels
          <em>between</em> bounded systems — they enable communication across application boundaries without dissolving
          them. The accessibility tree does something structurally different. It provides a unified description layer
          <em>across</em> applications — a uniform, live description of the interactive surface of the computer as a
          single addressable space, using a shared vocabulary: a button is a button regardless of which process produced
          it, which language it was written in, or which vendor shipped it. Applications, in this representation, are
          incidental containers — a process ID, a window frame — not fundamental units of organization.
        </p>
        <p>
          This infrastructure was not designed for interoperability, software composition, or end-user modification. It
          was designed so that blind, visually impaired, and motor-impaired people could use computers. A screen reader
          must be able to narrate
          <em>any</em> application; a switch control system must be able to act on <em>any</em> interactive element.
          Universality was non-negotiable because anything less would leave disabled people at the mercy of each
          individual developer’s willingness to cooperate and coordinate. In practice, compliance is uneven: Electron
          applications often expose impoverished trees, custom-drawn interfaces may expose almost nothing, and web
          applications frequently produce broken ARIA markup. The result is what Dolmage calls <em>retrofitting</em>:
          applications are built first, and then an accessibility layer is imposed as a corrective, after the fact.
          <a id="loc-11" href="#loc-26" role="doc-biblioref">[11]</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet accessibility infrastructure has proven remarkably durable, surviving the desktop-to-mobile transition,
          the native-to-web transition, and multiple platform generations. It is sustained not by the continued energy
          of researchers or the continued funding of a particular project, but by a self-reproducing political and legal
          structure: organized constituencies, legal instruments (ADA, Section 508, EU accessibility directives),
          institutional obligations on platform vendors, and the ongoing threat of litigation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Against the definitions debated at Substrates-25, the accessibility tree provides a <em>foundation</em> rather
          than a substrate. It satisfies none of Edwards’ criteria — it is not a programming system, has no persistent
          store, provides no direct manipulation. It partially meets Klokmose’s principles
          <a id="loc-12" href="#loc-27" role="doc-biblioref">[12]</a>: cross-application manipulability and layered
          semantics, but not transclusion, appropriation in use, or history. It has a relationship to Basman’s concept
          of disclosure <a href="#loc-21" role="doc-biblioref">[6]</a> — the accessibility tree is literally a
          disclosure mechanism, making the internal structure of applications legible to external processes — but it
          discloses only interface metadata, not structured data or computational operations. It provides an ontological
          foundation without the material depth. These limitations are traces of the specific political demand that
          produced the infrastructure: the demand for machine-readable interfaces <em>for assistive technology</em>, not
          for general-purpose composition. The technology is shaped by the scope of the struggle that won it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Gobert frames a productive tension between <em>modern</em> and <em>postmodern</em> approaches to substrates:
          modernism proposes replacing existing systems with something designed from the ground up; postmodernism
          accepts the computing world as it is and designs within its constraints.
          <a id="loc-13" href="#loc-28" role="doc-biblioref">[13]</a> Kell’s <em>compatibilism</em> — “embracing the
          existing code that already does the job” rather than building facsimiles — is one version of the postmodern
          position. <a id="loc-14" href="#loc-29" role="doc-biblioref">[14]</a> But what neither framing fully addresses
          is the question of <em>durability</em>: what socio-economic conditions must hold for substrate infrastructure
          to persist once its creators’ energy dissipates? The accessibility case, we argue, demonstrates that
          durability requires forces external to commodity logic.
        </p>
        <h2>4. Reflections from Allio</h2>
        <p>
          Allio is an experimental system that materializes a proto-substrate (a system which lacks many properties of a
          fully-realized substrate, but which shifts the ontology from app-centric to material-centric) on top of
          accessibility infrastructure. Where the traditional model pairs a specific assistive technology to the
          accessibility API in a one-to-one relationship — a screen reader consuming the tree, a switch control acting
          through it — Allio exposes the tree as a general-purpose surface on which
          <em>arbitrary</em> augmentations can be built. In Gobert’s terms, this is a <em>postmodern</em> approach —
          building on found infrastructure <a href="#loc-28" role="doc-biblioref">[13]</a> — animated by the structural
          analysis of <em>why</em> this particular infrastructure exists and what political conditions sustain it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Allio maintains a synchronized cache of accessibility state from the operating system and exposes it to
          browser-based clients, so that web technologies serve as the authoring environment for augmentations that
          operate on native applications. The closest analogue is the browser’s DOM — a queryable, semantically
          described tree of interactive elements — but unlike the DOM, which is sandboxed per origin, Allio’s tree spans
          all open applications, exposing their structure as a single unified space. Because the tree exposes bounding
          boxes for every element, Allio can render web-based overlays on top of the desktop, layered to respect window
          depth ordering — augmenting applications from the outside.
        </p>
        <figure>
          <video controls><source src="./media/allio.mp4" type="video/mp4" /></video>
          <figcaption
            style="margin-top: 0.5rem; font-style: italic; color: var(--text-secondary, #666); font-size: 0.9rem"
            >Three demonstrations of the capabilities of the proto-substrate, Allio.</figcaption
          >
        </figure>
        <p>
          We have built several prototypes on top of Allio including a find-and-replace feature which works for any text
          field, a CSS-like query language to extract data from the tree and pipe it between different applications, and
          a physics simulation which incorporates window geometry into the simulation. In each case, UI affordances are
          rendered on top of, around the edges of, and behind application windows so as to match the native window
          manager’s notion of depth order and application focus.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have demonstrated Allio to several audiences — researchers, developers, and people with no technical
          background — and their reactions have been remarkably consistent. People respond with genuine surprise at the
          <em>mundanity</em> of what they see. Cross-application find-and-replace is not exotic functionality — every
          text editor has find-and-replace. The surprise is at familiar capability appearing outside the container it
          was supposed to be confined to. People have been trained to understand specific text search tools as something
          that belongs to an application (a product), not something they do with text (a material). That is, the
          constraints imposed by the application model come to appear not as design choices but as facts about how
          computers work. The commodity form shapes not just what software provides but what users understand themselves
          to need.
        </p>
        <p>
          Developers are often more surprised than non-technical users. Where a non-developer reacts with curiosity — “I
          didn’t know you could do that” — developers react with disbelief: process isolation, sandboxing, and API
          boundaries are understood as architectural necessities, not contingent arrangements. Technical education
          deepens the naturalization rather than providing critical distance from it. The Parnas feedback loop — mode of
          production inscribing itself in tools, tools reproducing the mode of production — operates at the level of
          individual cognition as well as industry structure.
        </p>
        <p>
          The ease with which people denaturalize their assumptions is, we think, an argument for the postmodern
          approach: augmenting familiar environments builds a legibility and a constituency that designed-from-scratch
          substrates cannot. But constituency at the level of experience does not automatically translate into change at
          the level of infrastructure. The limits catalogued below are not ones that a compelling demo can dissolve.
        </p>
        <p>
          Building Allio has made concrete the technical limits of this foundation. Accessibility trees are
          predominantly pull-based — consumers must poll for state, and events are inconsistent across platforms — and
          biased toward reading over writing, since screen readers need to observe interfaces, not modify them. These
          first two limitations likely reflect the performance constraints and architectural assumptions of the era in
          which the APIs were designed. The deeper gap is semantic: the tree describes elements generically — a text
          field is “a text field containing these characters,” not “a Markdown editor with these operations.” The
          foundation provides an ontology of interface but not of content or computation. This limitation does trace to
          the scope of the constituency that fought for the infrastructure: the demand was for machine-readable
          interfaces for assistive technology, not for general-purpose composition, and the technology was shaped
          accordingly.
        </p>
        <h2>5. Accessibility is Malleability</h2>
        <p>
          The substrates research community has been exploring how to give people agency over the computational
          materials of their work. Disability rights movements have been fighting for this too, under different names
          and through different means, for far longer. But these are not identical programmes, and conflating them risks
          the appropriation that Shew warns against under the name
          <em>technoableism</em> — the assumption that technology is a “solution” for disability, that disabled people
          await being “fixed.” <a id="loc-15" href="#loc-30" role="doc-biblioref">[15]</a> If research builds on
          accessibility infrastructure without centering the people whose political struggle produced it, it risks
          extracting value from hard-won infrastructure for purposes its creators had no part in defining.
        </p>
        <p>
          This risk must be confronted directly. Allio repurposes accessibility infrastructure for general augmentation,
          and the honest assessment is that this sits in an ambiguous position. We think two conditions distinguish
          engagement from extraction. First, general-purpose use of accessibility trees creates a broader constituency
          with an interest in the trees’ richness and reliability — if more tools depend on the tree, more pressure
          exists to ensure applications expose complete and accurate trees, which directly benefits assistive technology
          users. Second, and more importantly, broadening the constituency must not displace the specific needs of
          disabled users. The disability rights demand for accessible software is not a special case of the substrates
          demand for malleable software; it is a prior and independent demand with its own political legitimacy.
          Substrates researchers who build on this foundation have, at minimum, an obligation not to treat accessibility
          compliance as a technical convenience while ignoring the access needs that motivated it.
        </p>
        <p>
          What disability studies contributes to the substrates programme is not a metaphor but a structural analysis
          and a political precedent. The social model’s core insight — that disability is produced by environments, not
          by bodies — is a claim about the relationship between people and the systems they inhabit. The demand that
          software be accessible <em>is</em> a demand that it be malleable: malleable enough to accommodate the
          diversity of bodies, senses, cognitive styles, and interaction modalities that the commodity form, through its
          production of the unmarked user, treats as edge cases. Malleability, in this framing, is not an abstract
          design goal but an access need — one that the commodity form of software systematically fails to meet.
        </p>
        <p>
          The political precedent is equally important. Designed substrates often die when their creators’ energy
          dissipates, because they exist in tension with the logic that organizes the rest of computing. Church’s
          question — where might alternative sources of patronage come from? — is one the accessibility case answers
          concretely.
          <a href="#loc-23" role="doc-biblioref">[8]</a> Accessibility infrastructure is not sustained by patronage. It
          is sustained by <em>counter-power</em> — organized constituencies capable of imposing costs on non-compliance
          — that won legal mandates, creating a self-reproducing structure of law and institutional obligation that
          persists independently of any particular researcher, company, or funding cycle. This demonstrates that
          computing infrastructure organized against the grain of capital <em>can</em> be made durable, if the political
          conditions are met.
        </p>
        <p>
          This reframes a central challenge of the substrates programme. The technical problems — reactivity,
          composability, disclosure, structured I/O — are real and difficult. But the accessibility case suggests that
          the deeper challenge is political-economic: how to produce and sustain infrastructure that is economically
          selected against. The current demand for AI agents to interact with arbitrary applications lends new urgency
          to this question: agent frameworks increasingly use accessibility trees as their primary interface to desktop
          software, creating for the first time a <em>market incentive</em> to enrich exactly the infrastructure that
          was previously sustained only against market logic. Whether this convergence deepens the foundation for
          everyone or produces new enclosures built on decades of disability rights organizing is a question where the
          substrates community’s values are directly at stake.
        </p>
        <p>
          This does not mean that substrate researchers must become political organizers. It means that the question of
          <em>who sustains</em> substrate infrastructure and <em>through what social mechanisms</em> is as important as
          the question of what properties it should have. The accessibility case offers both a model and a caution: a
          model of infrastructure sustained by organized counter-power, and a caution that such infrastructure will
          reflect the specific scope and demands of the constituency that fought for it.
        </p>
        <h2>6. Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          The substrates research programme has produced compelling visions of what computing could be and has built
          working prototypes that demonstrate these properties within their own boundaries. What it has not yet fully
          reckoned with is the question of
          <em>durability</em>: how substrate infrastructure can persist under the socio-economic conditions of commodity
          software production. The accessibility case provides a precedent — not a template, but a demonstration that
          computing infrastructure organized against the grain of the commodity form can endure, if it is embedded in a
          self-reproducing structure of organized political power.
        </p>
        <p>
          Allio demonstrates that this foundation can be materialized into a proto-substrate for cross-application
          augmentation — and that when it is, the dissolution of application boundaries produces genuine surprise, which
          is evidence of how deeply the commodity form has shaped not just what software provides but what users
          understand themselves to need. Allio also demonstrates the limits: the technical gaps it encounters trace
          variously to historical design constraints and to the scope of the political demand that produced the
          infrastructure. Deepening this foundation will require both technical work and a broadening of the
          constituency that sustains it.
