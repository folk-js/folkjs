> ⚠️ This project is in an _active_ research phase. It hasn't been published to NPM yet, but our work is open and you're more than welcome to take a look, poke around, and try things out.

## Explorations

- How do we make the web feel more alive and soft?
- How can we more easily connect web pages and their data?
- How easily can we turn a HTML document into a spatial canvas and visa versa?
- What would it look like if the browser had primitives for building spatial canvases?
- How can someone annotate, re-layout, and program web pages they did not make or distribute?
- How can we compose visual programming interfaces, hypermedia, and LLMs that work on any web page?
