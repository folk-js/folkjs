 *
 * Implementation: n half-plane tests. Correctness assumes the polygon is
 * convex and CCW (both invariants enforced elsewhere — see {@link isPolygonCCW}).
 *
 * **Digon case (k=2)**: the two ideal vertices alone don't constrain finite
 * points — the actual constraint is carried by chord half-edges, which
 * `Face.contains` tests separately. We return `true` here so the chord
 * tests can do the work; for non-ideal-antipodal digons (degenerate),
 * `isPolygonCCW` already rejects them at face construction.

/**
 * Whether the convex polygon defined by `verts` (k ≥ 2) is wound CCW. Handles
 * any mix of finite and ideal vertices, including all-ideal polygons whose
 * boundary is the line at infinity (the four-wedge collapse / "infinite plane"
 * seed).
 *
 * **Digon case (k=2)**: only valid if both vertices are ideal and antipodal
 * (the two limit directions of a real line through R²). Such a digon is a
 * "slab" face bounded by 2 parallel chord HEs — orientation is encoded in
 * the chord HE directions, not in the vertex sequence, so this predicate
 * just validates the vertex configuration and trusts HE-level checks
 * (`validateAtlas`) for the rest.
 *
 * Convexity contract: every consecutive triple `(a, b, c)` must satisfy
 * `c` lies left-of-or-on directed edge `a → b` (no right turns). At least
 * one turn must be strictly positive (so the polygon isn't entirely degenerate).
 *
 * Two structural exceptions are allowed and *don't* contribute to the turn
 * accounting — both arise naturally in our operations and represent valid
 * convex shapes:
 *
 *  1. **Collinear chain vertices**: `b` is finite and lies on the segment
 *     `a → c` (zero-turn intermediate vertex on a long side). Strip
 *     rectangles use these to twin a single long side to a chain of
 *     neighbouring sub-faces.
 *  2. **Same-ideal-direction edges**: `(a, b)` or `(b, c)` are both ideal
 *     in the same direction (a degenerate at-infinity edge with zero
 *     length). Strip rectangles' two short ends terminate this way.
 *
 * **All-ideal polygons** (every vertex is at infinity): the boundary is
 * interpreted as a sequence of arcs along S¹. CCW is determined by the
 * angular sweep of the unit-direction vectors — every consecutive pair must
 * sweep CCW around S¹ (cross ≥ 0), with at least one strictly positive
 * sweep. (A chord between two ideal vertices cannot be distinguished from
 * an arc here, so polygons that mix arcs and ideal-ideal chords aren't
 * supported by this predicate; our mutation primitives reject that case.)

/**
 * Convexity measure for the directed line `a → b` against vertex `c`:

 * a polygon's vertices, this tests "no right turn at b" — equivalent to
 * convexity for a CCW polygon.
 *
 * Each junction kind contributes either a position vector (finite) or an
 * ideal direction. Crucially, ideal directions are used *as directions*
 * directly, never converted into "very far finite points" — that hack
 * only works when the polygon is anchored near the origin. With faces
 * that can be positioned anywhere via `face.frame`, an ideal `c`
 * collinear with edge `a → b` (e.g. `(0, h) → (1, h)` extended to `+x∞`)
 * must register zero, which only happens if we use `c` as a direction.
 *
 * Cases:
 *  - `a, b` both finite: line direction is `b - a`. For finite `c`, use
 *    displacement `c - a`. For ideal `c`, use the direction `c` itself.
 *  - `a` finite, `b` ideal: line continues in direction `b` from `a`.
 *    For finite `c`, use `c - a`. For ideal `c`, use `c`.
 *  - `a` ideal, `b` finite: line through `b` continues in direction `-a`
 *    (we approached `b` *from* `a`). For finite `c`, use `c - b`. For
 *    ideal `c`, use `c`.
 *  - `a, b` both ideal: along the line at infinity; only meaningful when
 *    `c` is finite (testing whether `c` lies inside the half-plane bounded
 *    by the chord-at-infinity from direction `a` to direction `b`). For
 *    same-direction `(a, b)` callers must skip via `sameIdealDirection`.
 *    Otherwise: line direction is `b - a` (chord through R²∪S¹ from a
 *    direction `a` to a direction `b`). Treat `c - midpoint` as the test
 *    vector — but in practice this configuration only occurs with `c`
 *    ideal too, which we punt on (return 1 as a no-op convexity vote).
